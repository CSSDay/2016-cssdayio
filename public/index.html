          Last year's conference was amazing! Check out the

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CSSDay.io</strong> is a one-day CSS conference with intermediate-to-advanced
          topics intended for programmers. Topics are not beginner level, so if you already know
          CSS enough to get by, you'll be a perfect fit. Do you just dabble in CSS? That's
          great, come level-up with us! Let us help you understand the parts of CSS that don't
          make sense.

        <span class="ribbon">Lunch is provided</span>

          The venue will be at <img src="/images/sponsors/infusionsoft.svg" class="infusionsoft" alt="InfusionSoft">
          in Chandler, Arizona. We will post more detailed information on the Venue and hotel options as the
          event approaches.

              The <a href="http://bit.ly/1I8CLq0">Homewood Suites</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1I8Cvav">Courtyard Phoenix / Chandler</a> are across the street to Infusionsoft where the event is held. The benefit here is proximity to the event. The downside is that there are no restaurants within walking distance. However there are plenty of restaurants within two minutes driving.

            <p>
              Another choice is the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mill+Avenue/@33.424672,-111.94041,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x872b08d7fff6c88f:0xe511d535f279739c">Tempe "Mill Avenue" district</a> which is where the afterhours-party will be and has many restaurants, hotels, and things to do. It's also much closer to the airport and there's a lightrail that goes from the airport to downtown Tempe. The afterhours party will be at Handlebar in Tempe, so consider that also :)

          <p>In this session, we'll manipulate SVG for a broad range of use cases. We'll implement an accessible icon system, we'll use sprites to create dynamic responsive animated graphics. We'll use SVGs as a window with clipPath, push the boundaries of the CPU with filters, and even combine techniques to create otherworldly effects. We'll even use SVGs to make a game in React. This session will show off a broad range of SVG capabilities - from common use cases to innovative creations.</p>

          <p>If working on a CSS codebase has become a nightmare of specificity, code bloat and every time you try and remove CSS something breaks, this talk may be for you. We will focus on how applying concepts from functional programming can make your CSS truly reusable, easier to manage for large teams, and maybe, just maybe, you will start to love CSS.</p>

          <p>For far too long we've been forced to reuse layout patterns that have worked in the past, creating a web full of sites that all look the same. Narrow timelines, browser support restrictions and lack of a true grid system have led us to create work that is "good enough".</p>
          <p>I've spent years exploring how we can make the web a more unique space. CSS Grid Layout is on the horizon and will play a major role in the design of our sites. Finally having a true, 2 dimensional grid will give our layouts much more flexibility and it is on us to explore the possibilities.</p>
